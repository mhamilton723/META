# META
Meta Analysis Tool for Algorithms (META) is a model selection tool that interfaces with sklearn objects.
It adds Meta Estimators to sklearn allowing one to perform grid search over algorithms as well as parameters.
It also adds the functionality of searching over the parameter space of your entire pipeline without manually creating the parameter space. 
The system also incorporates bagging and plotting of the best algorithms found.
